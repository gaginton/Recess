Recess is a project by Guy Ginton and King of the Chill.
The basis is an app to get you out the house, and to a game or event, as soon as possible.
Additional features will relate to leagues, scoring, communication and online gaming.

This app favores Node Packages over building everything from scratch.
It also will be built for minimal calls and server expenses. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
